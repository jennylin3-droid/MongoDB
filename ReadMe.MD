##Question
a. When comparing relational databases (RDBMS) like MySQL with non-relational, document-oriented databases like MongoDB, several distinctions emerge.The key difference that significantly impact database design are schema flexibility and the underlying data storage model.
    -Schema: Tables are defined with a predetermined set of columns, each with a specific data type. This rigid structure enforces consistency and data integrity, ensuring that every row within a table adheres to the defined schema. 
    -Data Storage Model: Document databases store data as documents, typically in JSON or BSON format. These documents can contain nested key-value pairs, allowing for the embedding of related data within a single document.


b. In healthcare using MongoDB is appropriate for building a patient health record system that stores wide variety of patient data. The flexible schema, Embedded data, and scalability allows to generate huge amount of handling growing datas.
